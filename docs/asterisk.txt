Asterisk usage
==============

You can use this plugin with your existing Asterisk installation.

You need to :

* Create a dummy device with **device = /ddev/null** as value for example.
* Don't start the plugin! It would be useless.
* Configure Asterisk to send a xPL message when an inbound call is received. See the :doc:`xPL message description </dev>` for more informations about this message.
