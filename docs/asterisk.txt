Asterisk usage
==============

You can use this plugin with your existing Asterisk installation.

You need to :

* Create a dummy device with **device = /ddev/null** as value for example.
* Don't start the plugin! It would be useless.
* Configure Asterisk to send a xPL message when an inbound call is received. See the :doc:`xPL message description </dev>` for more informations about this message.

For exemple on two separatated machine one running asterisk that can ssh without password to one running domogik

in your asterisk/extensions.conf in the inbound call:
[from-pstn]
exten => s,1,Gosub(prevenir,s,1)

and add a new sub prevenir like this one:

[prevenir]
exten => s,1,Wait(0)
same => n, System(nohup ssh domogik@domogikIP 'python /path/to/your/domogik/bin/send.py xpl-trig cid.basic "calltype=inbound,phone=${CALLERID(num)}"' &)
same => n, Return
